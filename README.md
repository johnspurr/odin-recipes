# odin-recipes

This is my Recipes page project for [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic understanding of Git and HTML. I will use the basic git workflow introduced earlier in the Foundations course and create a very basic recipes webpage.
